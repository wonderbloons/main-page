            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Wonder Bloons only aims for one thing and that is the <strong> JOY </strong> we could bring to our customers with the service we provide. </p>
            <h2>Question & Answers</h2>
            <p> <strong> Q:  </strong> Do you do custom or personalised balloons?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> Yes! That is exactly what we specialise in.
                <br> You can choose from many options such as the size of the balloons, design, fillings, accessories, prints and many more! </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:  </strong> Do you charge extra for words printed on balloon?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> No! It is complimentary as part of your balloon purchases. </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:  </strong> Do you offer a more flexible balloon arrangement?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> Yes, here in Wonder Bloons, our team is dedicated in making your dream balloon bouquet come true. </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> Do you offer delivery and what is the delivery fee?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> Yes, however we only deliver to Brisbane Region, Ipswich, Gold Coast and Caboolture. Delivery fee may range from $5 ~ $45.
                <br> If you are located close to those regions, but unsure if we do deliver to where you are, please feel free to contact us via email and provide us your postcode. </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> When should I collect my balloons?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> For the balloons to look its best, we would highly recommend you to pick up the balloons on your collection date. Your balloons can be collected at 13 Fenton St, Fairfield, 4103 QLD during these times (Mon-Fri:
                6:00pm - 9:00pm, Sat: 9:00am - 1:00pm, Sun: 9:00am-12:00pm)<br> If you would like to change your collection date or collect out of these times, please let us know at least 3 days before your collection time. <br></p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> What if I am only able to pick up the balloons before the collection date?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> As 12" latex balloons generally last 8~12 hours, pickup outside this time means we will have to specially prepare your balloons to increase their float time and this will incur a $8.00 fee. At maximum the balloons
                will last 2-3 days.</p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> Am I able to make changes to the print on the balloons?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> We will only accept minor changes if notified at least a day before the time of collection. Depending on the change required, we may incur a $5.00 fee. </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> I have a design in mind, what do I need to send to you?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> That's great! You could send us the design in png, jpg, eps or svg format. </p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> How long do my balloons last?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> It all depends on the temperature and balloon type. Clear bubble balloons and foil balloons last 2~4 days whilst 12" latex balloons last 8~12 hours. If you would like the latex balloons to last longer than a
                day, we will apply Hi-Float to each latex balloons for $1.50 each. This extends the float time to 2~3 days.</p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> What payment methods do you accept?
                <br> <strong> A: </strong> We accept cash upon pick-up, bank transfer, Paypal and Alipay. We will be accepting payments over credit or debit soon.</p>
            <p> <strong> Q:</strong> How can I contact you?
